Here, I have used the dataset "Countries of the World" (added to the repository from Kaggle). The data comes from 227 countries and territories, contains information about some of the important factors that govern economic development.  In this, I have done exploratory data analysis and made a predictive model for GDP per capita, as this is the key indicator of economic development of any country. For building a better model, I have performed hyperparameter tuning of XGBoost and RandomForest.  In addition, I have found the key features that determine GDP per capita. Also, I have checked some other ingredients of Economic development and the relationships between them.
